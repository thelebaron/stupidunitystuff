         * In this example, we'll explore what "port forwarding" is, and how to use it.
         *
         * Port forwarding is the node set's version of subgraphs. Since a node set otherwise always represents a
         * flattened graph, there has to be a solution for embedding sub graphs.
         *
         * The solution here is to allow nodes to act as "shells" around other nodes, that, to the outside world,
         * appear as one node - one unit of functionality. Modelling subgraphs as isomorphic nodes is important not only
         * for performance, but also for encapsulation: A user of a node shouldn't have to care whether it is one node
         * or many, as long as it upholds its end of the contract: The data protocol (I/O port description).
         *
         * This is a core philosophy but also the basis of composability and reusability: If someone has already
         * implemented some basic functionality you need in a more complex node, why not reuse it? This authoring
         * principle holds both for working in code with the node set API, as well as in compositable UI editors.
         *
         * It works like this: The parent node (commonly nicknamed the "uber node") declares the inputs and outputs
         * which will be visible publicly. The initialization of that node uses the provided initialization context to
         * forward any of its ports to child node ports.
         *
         * Port forwarding is supported for both inputs and outputs, and applies recursively and transitively. The runtime
         * resolves the forwarding once during node creation, after that, any connections made to a forwarded port will
         * result in a direct connection between the source and destination skipping over the parent node.
         *
         * Let's use the weak system now for a couple of simple tasks we already covered, like connections.
