         * In this example, we'll explore what "weak typing" is, and how to use it.
         *
         * Up until now, we've been using the node set's strongly typed API, where all node and port types are exactly
         * specified at compile time (e.g. "MyNode.KernelPorts.MyPort"). There are often situations where you don't know
         * the exact node types you are dealing with, or what sort of ports they have - only that they should be able to connect
         * together.
         *
         * A common use case here is generic controller code, like a timeline. A timeline can be extended with new
         * nodes and tracks, but that doesn't mean the runtime scheduler and controller need explicit compile time knowledge of the
         * node types it will be dealing with - only that they support some expected data protocol.
         *
         * To that end, the node set includes a runtime type information system so that:
         * 1) A user can introspect a node's capabilities
         * 2) At runtime, the node set can verify that weakly typed operations are safe
         *
         * In particular, every node definition carries a port description. This is a list of every input port
         * and output port declared by the node definition, including what declared type it is and its category:
         * data / message / DSL etc.
         *
         * A node's port identifiers are declared in its node definition (e.g. DataInput<MyNode, float> or MessageOutput<MyNode, long>). The
         * weakly typed analog for these are InputPortID and OutputPortID, which is what you'll find in the port
         * description. You will also find a weakly typed analog for every API in the node set taking
         * strongly typed node and port arguments.
         *
         * The strongly typed system not only provides better performance (by reducing runtime checks) but also leads
         * to clearer and more readable code: The named symbols being connected together are given explicitly
         * rather than some meaningless indices on generic node handles. Furthermore, invalid connections and such
         * will not even compile.
         *
         * In general, compositing UI tools rely heavily on the weak system, while handwritten DataFlowGraph code will
         * usually rely more on the strong system. It's important to note that the extra runtime checks which occur when
         * using the weak system only incur a performance penalty at the API callsite. e.g. Extra runtime checks
         * will be performed when initially establishing a connection using the weak API, but performance beyond
         * that would be identical to a connection established using the strong API.
         *
         * Let's use the weak system now for a couple of simple tasks we already covered.
