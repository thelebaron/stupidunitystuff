         * In this example, we'll explore what "rendering" means, and how to use it.
         *
         * As covered in the previous example ("simulation"), execution is split into two parts in a nodeset. Inside
         * the simulation, flow happens through messages, while in the rendering it happens through "raw" data.
         *
         * The connection points between data inputs/outputs are done in the same way in a separate port definition
         * (IKernelPortDefinition) and processing of the data happens in small kernels (IGraphKernel<>).
         *
         * Thus data flows through a separate graph of data connection topology, colloquially referred to as the "render graph".
         * The class of problems you solve using this system can generally be referred to as data dependency
         * processing, likely including complex DAGs with lots of buffers like audio DSP graphs or animation
         * FK / IK graphs.
         *
         * Rendering happens after simulation, where the graph has usually been mutated. An optimal execution
         * is then incrementally built on top of the previous rendering and the diff of changes that happened.
         *
         * Rendering runs asynchronously in jobs, although this can be configured (see NodeSet.RenderModel).
         * To extract results of the rendering, you would generally use graph values as we'll cover later.
         *
         * Concretely in this example, we'll cover the steps needed to have a graph kernel that will be run inside the
         * rendering pass.

             * resolved / processed, or in other words: Whenever its input dependencies (if any) are complete.
             * This is equivalent to the topological sort of the nodes (vertices) arranged together with the given
             * connections (edges) made in the particular set.
