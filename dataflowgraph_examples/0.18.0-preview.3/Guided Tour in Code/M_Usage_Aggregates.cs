         * like standard types like matrices / vectors, or structures with buffers and other aggregates.
         *
         * In general, ports of aggregate types are treated the same as non-aggregate ports. There is
         * however a special syntax used for aggregates which include buffers.
         *
         * Let's look at a concrete example of the syntax with a more complicated port layout.
